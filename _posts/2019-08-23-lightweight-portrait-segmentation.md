title: ExtremeC3Net&#58; Extreme Lightweight Portrait Segmentation Networks using Advanced C3-modules
---
In our recent paper [ExtremeC3Net: Extreme Lightweight Portrait Segmentation Networks using Advanced C3-modules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03093), we introduce a new extremely lightweight portrait segmentation model consisting of a two-branched architecture based on the concentrated-comprehensive convolutions block. Our method reduces the number of parameters from 2.08M to 37.9K (around 98.2% reduction), while maintaining the accuracy within a 1% margin from the state-of-the-art portrait segmentation method.
